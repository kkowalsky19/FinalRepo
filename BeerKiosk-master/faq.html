    <li>
      The bar decides exactly what drink is being served. We currently only support
      beer, but plan to add support mixed drinks in the future.

  <li>How do I order?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Go the main site page, and choose how many beers you'd like, then enter your
      phone number and credit card information. If the transaction was approved, then
      you will receive your codes via text. Enter the codes at the kiosk and the drink
      will be dispensed right after.
